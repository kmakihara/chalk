          <div class="article-content">
            <p>I chose to make a website as my final project because, along with this topic, it very much represents who I am. I am a fairly technical person, that has spent much of his life, and indeed Harvard career, refining a set of quantitative skills. However, as I’m sure you’ve seen, my interests are not limited to the technical field. I’ve dabbled in creative writing, and I spend time drawing when I get the free time. In the process of making this website, I actually learned some new technical skills, as well as discovered some interesting new philosophies (I went on a rather deep Foucault binge). This is a rather long-winded introduction into what my project is. It is a mosaic, or rather matrix, that links the conduct of technology to the conduct of life.</p>

<p>The matrix of videos is constructed as such. As you go from top down, you follow a progression of technological advancement. As you go from left to right on each row, you follow a progression of technological penetration, specifically AI penetration. What I mean by AI penetration is the ability for AI to effectively function as a decision maker, making the decisions that humans usually make. In a nutshell: the conduct of AI. Although this matrix is rather simple, it’s allowed me to draw some rather interesting, if not controversial conclusions. It may be easier to understand once I explain everything row by row, column by column.</p>

<h4 id="row-1--primitive-technologies">Row 1 – primitive technologies:</h4>
<p>The first video is an amusing clip from Charlie Chaplin’s classic, Modern Times. In it, Chaplin plays a factory worker who desperately attempts to spice up the monotony of life on the assembly line. While of comedic nature, the film serves as a critique of just how dehumanizing it can be to work on a factory floor; quite literally be a cog in the machine. They follow a strict schedule to maximize efficiency, perform assigned tasks, and repeat the process until the factory’s job is done (it never is). And it is these workers that are the first to go in the robotic revolution.</p>

<p>The second clip is from another comedy, Joe Pesci’s classic My Cousin Vinny. In it, Joe Pesci’s character trades blows with a lawyer from the South, making his infamous “yutes” comment. Interestingly enough, real life lawyers actually praised the film for its accurate portrayal of a trial. I chose to include this clip because it both depicts and satirizes the formulaic nature of a court room. In law, using the framework of legal positivism, there is a set of rules that governs every trial which can be utilized to resolve the proceedings. At the same time, there is plenty of room for interpretation, and even comedy, as Joe Pesci has shown us. In a similar vein, AI is slowly beginning to enter the legal sphere, with programs combing over decades of legal data to construct a defense or even come to a proper verdict. And yet, the open-endedness of certain trials prevents AI from being used at a full capacity. In other words, AI is yet to be used in situations that are “up for interpretation”.</p>

<p>Finally, the third clip is an excerpt from a debate between Michel Foucault and Noam Chomsky. In it, they discuss human nature, institutions, and essentially the conduct of life. I included this clip because to me it is a display of masterful intelligence that AI still cannot solve. As a side note, Noam Chomsky is one of the most influential professors when it comes to the grammar of computing. These philosophical questions about what is good for society, or even the definition of good, are still beyond the realm of AI programs. And yet, mankind being the proverbial curious cat, impressive attempts are still being made to bring AI in to philosophy. This will be further revealed as we advance to the second row.</p>

<h4 id="row-2--advanced-technologies">Row 2 – advanced technologies:</h4>
<p>We begin with the legendary enigma machine, the Nazi encryption device that was cracked by Alan Turing, effectively turning the tide of WWII. It is one of the earliest examples of computing being used to solve complex problems. In fact, many computer scientists view Alan Turing as the godfather of computing. However, the enigma cypher still operates based on a series of cogs and wheels. The machine produces a finite number of possibilities, albeit a herculean number of possibilities, but still finite. This form of cryptography is easily replaceable, just like the poor Chaplin on the factory line. In fact, just last year it took AI Program Enigma Pattern just 13 minutes to crack the enigma cypher.</p>

<p>The second clip in this row is arguably the earliest example of the triumph of artificial intelligence. In this clip, IBM’s Deep Blue, a chess program trained using machine learning, defeats then chess world champion Garry Kasparov in just 19 moves. Deep Blue has been constructed to do one thing and one thing only: play chess. And yet, you could very well argue that up until that point, Garry Kasparov’s meaning of life had also been chess. Both the AI program and its opponent had very similar conducts of “life”. It is only after Kasparov’s retirement that he begins to explore and participate in politics and forms a philosophy not around chess. It is here that we begin to see the abilities of AI to mimic, even surpass humans. Deep Blue took chess to levels humanity had not seen before. Yes, it is simply a game, but there’s a reason game theory has such a prominent role in philosophy.</p>

<p>The third clip is essentially an extension of the second clip. In it, IBM Watson (IBM at it again!) decisively trounces two other jeopardy contestants. It is an example of the evolution of AI. No longer are AI machines pigeonholed into specific roles such as playing chess or solving puzzles (a bit of a misnomer since all AI is solving puzzles), Watson can begin to make decisions on his own. Initially this is in the scope of jeopardy, but Watson can make decisions outside the scope of finding the right answer to the question. With the addition of monetary goals and the performance of his opponents, Watson must calculate the expected values of performing one decision over the other, and weigh these choices to determine his response. Another layer has been added to the AI’s conduct of life. Today, Watson is used by businesses worldwide to help make decisions. In many ways Watson is an extra person in the room, that contributes and responds based on the information available, and what Watson sees as best. Though these parameters are initially coded, by nature of the program Watson must learn and update these internal metrics as he sees fit. Though not a fully independent thinker, Watson is certainly one step closer to be the AI academic.</p>

<h4 id="row-3--forefront-technologies">Row 3 – forefront technologies:</h4>
<p>The first clip is a display of just how sinister technology can be. The US Air-Force exhibits is most feared drone, the MQ-9 Reaper UAV. Drones like these have been responsible for numerous civilian deaths and continue to be a source of protest from human rights groups across the globe. A killing weapon developed by the most powerful military in the world, this drone contains some of the most advanced technology to date. And yet, these drones are still manned, governed by the strict rules on engagement of warfare. Of course, many of these laws of engagement are violated, but they are still in place. A lethal killing machine as such still does not have its own agency, a way to have its own life, other than through human control. This is not to say these machines aren’t in development. Lethal Autonomous Weapons are on the minds of every military expert and machine learning scientist out there. One can only imagine how the world will change once we deploy these machines with minds of their own.</p>

<p>The second clip is the second iteration of our very first clip: the new assembly line worker. This clip follows a WSJ reporter visiting factories producing industrial manufacturing robots. These robots use artificial intelligence to perform tasks that previously only humans could, such as picking up miscellaneous items and correcting faults in machinery. Not only that, these robots are also themselves manufactured by robots. We have artificial intelligence spawning artificial intelligence, a characteristic previously only associated with living creatures. The clip goes on to say that the most successful factory robots are actually cooperative robots, robots that work together with humans. Not only do these robots interact with themselves, they freely interact and cooperate with humans. These cooperative robots have an interesting and more personal grasp on their “conduct of life” than IBM Watson does.</p>

<p>The third clip is the intersection of both extremes: technological advancement and AI penetration. Here, we see MIT attempting to solve the ethical dilemmas that self-driving cars will face by crowdsourcing opinions. MIT will then use these opinions to train a machine-learning algorithm that will control a self-driving car. To me, this is one of the most interesting and important fields of computer science: the ethics of artificial intelligence. How are robots supposed to make ethical decisions? Ethical decisions are specifically human and intensely philosophical. As we saw in the debate between Chomsky and Foucault, different philosophies can have different solutions to different situations. So how is MIT solving these issues? By crowdsourcing opinions. MIT is “injecting” humanity into its machine learning programs. And to me, this is the closest AI has gotten to grasping its conduct of life.</p>

<h4 id="columns">Columns</h4>
<p>I will now go through each column and reveal my somewhat controversial findings from this process. The first column is the largely unsophisticated, and in my view, unliberated column. Though with each row the technology gets more advanced, the “tools” still remain constrained and governed by the laws of monotony. In fact, the most liberated in this scenario is the factory worker since the factory worker has the opportunity to rebel.</p>

<p>The second column takes a step towards more freedom and a clearer conduct of life. The lawyer, deep blue, and the AI powered factory robots all have a certain amount of agency to make their own decisions. The lawyer through interpretation, Deep Blue through pushing the boundaries of chess, and cooperative robots through supervised and cooperative manufacturing.</p>

<p>Finally, the third column is ultimate liberation and acceptance of one’s existence. The philosophers Chomsky and Foucault may not necessarily know their place in the world, but they aggressively study it and have formed their own views on how they should carry themselves through life. IBM Watson makes large scale decisions outside of its own personal domain, providing advice on what actions companies should take. Finally, the crowdsourced MIT program makes ethical decisions based on human life, where the valuations are no longer cut and dry. The MIT program quite literally needs to have an “opinion” on what it should do. In addition, the MIT program also has the ability to learn from its actions and better formulate future actions, not just from a mechanical point of view but from an ethical point of view.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>I read an interesting excerpt from a book last year called The Buddha in the Robot, where an engineer examines whether robots can have a buddha-like nature, or even achieve nirvana. This course has given me much to think about when it comes to intrinsic nature of AI, and whether robots can have their own ways to conduct life. It has definitely been one of the most interesting and intellectually challenging courses I have taken at Harvard, and I’d like to thank you for supporting me along the way.</p>
